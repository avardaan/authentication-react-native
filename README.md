# authentication-react-native
a simple react-native app that uses firebase authentication (from Stephen Grider's Udemy course)

if the user is registered, the screen changes to show a logout button.
if the user is not registered, the Log In button registers them and logs them in.
if login/registration fail, an error message is shown.
